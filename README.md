# Slack profile photo weather updater

This project updates your slack profile photo with a photo based on the weather.


## Configuration
You need to provide:
* Two profile photos with a transparent background, for daytime and nighttime. By default, place them in `profile_photos/photo.png` and `profile_photos/night_photo.png`.
* Environment variables:
  - Copy the `config.toml.template` file to `config.toml`.
  - Edit the variables:
    - `weatherstack__api_access_key`: the api key for your account on weatherstack.com.
    - `slack__workspace`: the slack workspace where you want to change your profile photo
    - `slack__token`, `slack__cookie_d`: see below.
    - `latitude`, `longitude`: the location for the weather conditions that will be used to fill in the background in your profile photo.

### Retrieving the slack token and cookie values
* Log into slack in a browser on a computer.
* Enable developer tools in the browser, and open the network tab.
* Manually change your profile photo to any photo you want.
* Inspect the request in the developer tools network tab on the `/api/users.setPhoto` endpoint.
  - Copy the value of the `token` parameter into `slack__token` in your `config.toml` file.
  - For the `slack__cookie_d` env var, look at the `cookie` header, and extract the value of the `d=` part of the cookie.

### Optional parameters
* `profile_photos_dir`: The directory containing your profile photos with the transparent background. it should contain a `photo.png` for daytime, and a `night_photo.png` for nighttime. the default location is in `profile_photos/` in the project.
* `polling_interval_s`: The frequency in seconds to update the profile photo. The default value is `7200`.
